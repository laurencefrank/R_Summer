# Function returming the cumulative sum of a vector

In this exercise you'll write your own cumulative sum function. This function returns the cumulative sums of the elements of a vector, and will work identically to the base R function `cumsum()`, e.g.

```{r}
cumsum(x = 1:4)
```

We'll take the following steps:

1.  Write the loop
2,  Make container object 
3.  Collect the results in a container object
4.  Embed 1 to 3 in the function `my_cumsum(x)`

But first make the vector `x` with the values `1:4`.

```{r}

```

a.  Now write a loop that computes the cumulative sums of `x`. This requires the following steps:

    1.  Define a `counter`, e.g. `i`
    2.  Define a `sequence` of integers that runs from 1 to the length of the vector `1:4`
    3.  The consecutive iterations should return the sum of `x[1:i]`
    4.  Use the `print()` command to print the outcome at each iteration

```{r}

```

b.  Now make a container object. The most obvious would be to make it a numeric vector with length is `length(x)`. Check the help page of the function `numeric()` on how to do that.

```{r}

```

c.  Now rewrite the loop so that it stores the cumulative sums in the container vector. Run the loop and check the content of the container vector.

```{r}

```

d.  Now include the container object and the loop in your function `my_cumsum(x)`, where `x` is the function argument denoting the vector for which the cumulative sums have to be returned. Run the function, and check wheter it appears in your workspace.

```{r}

```

b.  Apply your function to the vector `-4:4`, and compare its result to that of the base R function.

```{r}

```

# Advanced

Suppose we want to know the slopes, SEs, t-values and p-values of variables in `mtcars` as predictors of `mpg`. To avoid writing a lot of code we will do this using a loop.

To get the relevant information we have to 

1. Fit the model
2. Get the summary of the model
3. Extract the coefficients from the summary object (1st row is intercept, 2nd slope)
4. Remove the information about the intercept by filtering the 2nd row (slope)
5. Round the info to tree decimals to make it make it better readable


The base R code is

```{r}
round(coef(summary(lm(mpg ~ disp, mtcars)))[2, ], 3)
```

The code to do this with `dplyr` functions for the variable `disp` is shown below. Run this code step-by-step to see what it does.

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ disp, mtcars) %>%  # fit the model
  summary() %>%             # get the summary   
  coef() %>%                # extract the matrix with the coefficients info
  as.data.frame() %>%       # slice needs a data frame 
  slice(2) %>%              # keep the 2nd row with the slope
  unlist() %>%              # convert data frame back to a vector
  round(3)                  # round
```

a. The `mtcars` data has 11 variables, so 10 predictors of `mpg`. Make container matrix with 10 rows and 4 columns to store the information. Give the rows the names of the predictors, and the column names of the vector above. 

```{r}

```

b. Fill the rows of this matrix with the slopes, SEs, and t- and p-values for the corresponding predictors of `mpg` using a loop. The steps are:

     1. Define `sequence` by the column positions of the predictors in `mtcars`
     2. Fit the model `mpg ~ .` to a selection of the data (`mpg` + predictor)
     3. Run the code above to fill the container matrix.

```{r}

```
