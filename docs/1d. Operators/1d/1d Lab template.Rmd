# Data preparation

Run the code below that makes 5 vectors containing information about planets. 

```{r include=T}
planet     <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", 
                "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")

type     <- c("Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", 
              "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant", 
              "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant")

diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883)

rotation <- c(58.64, -243.02, 1, 1.03, 0.41, 0.43, -0.72, 0.67)

rings    <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)
```

# Subsetting vectors

a. Display the 2nd element of `rotation`.

```{r}

```

b. Display the 1st and 2nd element of `planet`.

```{r}

```

c. Display a logical vector with `TRUE` when `diameter > 1` and 
`FALSE` otherwise. 

```{r}
diameter > 1
```

d. Display the planets with a diameter greater than 1.

```{r}

```


# Subsetting data frames

a. Make a data frame called `planets` containing

    - the vector `planet` as row names
    - the other 4 vectors as variables with
    - the vector `type` as factor

```{r}

```


b. Remove the five separate vectors from the workspace with the function `rm()`. 

```{r}

```

c. Display the classes of the variables in `planets` with the function `str()`.

```{r}

```

d. Display the summary of `planets`. 

```{r}
summary(planets)
```

e. Display the variable `type` of `planets` using square brackets. 

```{r}
planets$type
```

f. Display the variable `diameter` of `planets` using the dollar sign. 

```{r}

```

g. Use the function `plot()` to make a scatter plot with `diameter`on the x-axis and `rotation` on the y-axis. (Hint: use the `$` sign).

```{r}

```


# Lists

a. Make a list `planets_list` containing the data frame `planets`, the levels of `type`,  and the mean of `diameter`. Give each list element an appropriate name.

```{r include=T, echo=T}

```

b. Display the third element of the list using double square brackets.

```{r}

```

c. Display the second element of the list using the dollar sign.

```{r}

```

# Adding an image to an R Markdown document

With the R Markdown syntax `![](<path, data file name>){width=xx%}` you can include an image in your R Markdown document. You have to specify the file path where the image file is located, the name of the image file. With the option `{width=50%}` you can influence the size of image, here it is 50\% of the original size. 

The best way to include an image in an R Markdown file is to **put the image file in the same folder as your Rmd file**. It is easier because you do not have to specify a file path. 

We are going to add the image `planets.jpg` to this Rmd document. Make sure the image `planets.jpg` is in the same folder as this R Markdown document `1b Lab template.Rmd`.

Now add the following code to this Rmd file to add the image `planets.jpg` and knit the document. 

`![](planets.jpg){width=50%}`


# Advanced

a. Display from the first list element (the data frame `planets`) the second and fourth element of the variable `rotation`.

```{r}

```
