# Quick overview

## Column

<!--### **Welcome!**-->

<!--Dear all,-->

<!--This summer you will participate in the [**USS24: Statistical
programming with
R**](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-statistical-programming-with-r)
course in Utrecht, the Netherlands.-->

<!--We look forward to see you all in Utrecht,-->

<!--*The Statistical Programming with R Team*-->

<!-- -   [Laurence Frank](https://www.uu.nl/staff/lefrank) (course director)-->
<!--    <br> -->
<!-- -   [Maarten Cruyff](https://www.uu.nl/staff/mcruyff)-->
<!-- -   [Mahdi Shafiee
    Kamalabad](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MShafieeKamalabad/)-->

### **Course description**

Students learn to operate `R`, to perform data manipulation and
visualisation, work with the (generalized) linear models, conduct
simulation studies (e.g. bootstrap) and present results of data analyses
in publication ready tables. We will work with the RStudio environment
and `R Markdown`. The focus will be on the `tidyverse` package.

R is a very popular and powerful platform for data manipulation,
visualization, and analysis and has a number of advantages over other
statistical software packages. A wide community of users contribute to
R, resulting in broad coverage of statistical procedures, including many
that are not available in any other statistical software.

### **Learning goals**

The course teaches students the skills needed to understand how R works
and how to use R for a variety of statistical analyses. The following
skills and learning goals are covered in this course:

-   Being able to work with the R environment (`RStudio`) and the online
    resources;
-   Perform reproducible data analyses with `R Markdown` and `RStudio`;
-   Master data manipulation (cleaning, transformation, re-coding) with
    `tidyverse`;
-   Summarizing data in publication-ready tables;
-   Make high-quality plots with `ggplot`;
-   Work with pipelines (`tidyverse`);
-   Fitting and interpreting (generalized) linear models;
-   Being able to perform a bootstrap;
-   Communicate the results of statistical analyses in reports,
    presentations and articles.

Room Pangea](https://goo.gl/maps/ufn6aXVL9K48Gn7S6)-->

### **Target audience, study load, certificate**

Applied researchers and (master) students who already use statistical
software and would like to learn to use, or improve their usage of, the
R environment. Understanding basic statistical theory such as t-tests,
hypothesis testing, and regression is required. Participants from a
variety of fields —including sociology, psychology, education, human
development, marketing, business, biology, medicine, political science,
and communication sciences— will benefit from this course.

**Study load:** five full time days, 1.5 ECTS <br>

**Certificate:** participants will receive a certificate at the end of
the course.

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### **Prepare your laptop before the course starts**

To be able to participate in this course, you have to prepare your
laptop in the following way:

**System requirements**

Bring a laptop computer to the course and make sure that you have full write 
access and administrator rights to the machine. Some corporate laptops come with 
limited access for their users, we therefore advice you to bring a personal 
laptop computer, if you have one. 

**1. Install the latest version of `R`**

`R` can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org).

**2. Install the latest version of `RStudio` Desktop**

`Rstudio` can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

*Please note that:*

-   It is important to ***install `R` first*** and then
    `RStudio Desktop`.
-   The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient for
    this course.

**3. Install packages**

Start `RStudio` and install the following packages by copy and paste these 
exact commands in the console pane:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "rmdformats", "prettydoc", 
                   "rticles", "hrbrthemes", "plotly", "patchwork", "shiny", 
                   "devtools", "boot", "gtsummary", "papaja", "car", "DAAG", 
                   "splines", "mice", "broom","janitor", "pacman", "gapminder",
                   "kableExtra"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify 
the console:

<center>
  <img src="figures/RStudioInterface.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 80%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the code in the console window and press the return key. 
When asked the question below, type `Yes` in the console and press the return 
key.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```


## Column 2

### **What if the steps to the left do not work for me?**

If all fails and you have insufficient rights to your machine, the
following web-based service will offer a solution.

1.  You will receive an account to Utrecht University's
    [MyWorkPlace](https://myworkplace.uu.nl/). You would have access to
    `R` and `RStudio` there. You may need to install packages for new
    sessions during the course.
2.  Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). You
    can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there.

### **Programming and resampling**

**Morning** Mastering the R programming language offers a significant
advantage by enabling you to write custom functions for tailored
statistical analyses. This morning you will learn to execute loops and
design your own functions.

**Afternoon** Being able to write your own functions becomes
particularly valuable in scenarios where traditional hypothesis testing
is inadequate due to violated assumptions or the inability to estimate
statistics using known distributions. In such situations, the bootstrap
method emerges as a highly versatile and practical tool. Its
implementation in R is remarkably straightforward, making it an
accessible and powerful approach to hypothesis testing.
